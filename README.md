# Dictionary
In this task, I have developed a dictionary console tool in Python programming language. This tool will generate a file where the list of words and their corresponding meanings are stored. The generated file is in .txt format. This tool has the following features:

 ● The tool will generate a .txt formatted file in the current directory.
 
 ● Tool will take word-meaning input and store it in the .txt file.
 
 ● The tool will take the word as input and return the meaning after searching through the .txt file.
 
 ● Tool will take the word as input and remove the word and its meaning from the .txt file.
